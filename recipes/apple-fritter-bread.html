            <h2>steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line a 1-pound loaf pan with parchment paper on all sides and set aside.</li>
                <li>First, make the cinnamon apples and cinnamon sugar. Combine the chopped apples, 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar and 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon together in small bowl and toss to combine. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Next, make the cinnamon sugar. Combine the 1/2 cup brown sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl and stir to combine. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Next, make the bread. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter, and granulated sugar. Beat on medium speed until light and fluffy.</li>
                <li>Use a silicone spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the eggs one at a time and beat at low speed, scraping down the bowl between each addition. Add the vanilla extract and mix well.</li>
                <li>AIn a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. With the mixer on low speed, add half the dry ingredients and mix slightly. Next add the milk and sour cream and mix slightly. Last, add the second half of dry ingredients and mix until just combined and no streaks of flour remain.</li>
                <li>Use a silicone spatula to transfer half the batter into the prepared loaf pan and spread into an even layer. Top with the half the cinnamon apples and sprinkle with half of the brown sugar. Spoon the remaining half of the batter over the apples, using a silicone spatula to spread into an even layer. Top with the remaining apples and cinnamon sugar.</li>
                <li>Bake until the cake is golden brown all over and a butter knife inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool.</li>
                <li>While the loaf cools, make the glaze. In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract until smooth. Once the loaf is cool, drizzle with the glaze and serve!</li>
